  Fill up all meta configuration in  `_config.yml`:

  ```yaml
    title: The title of the website
    email: Your email here
    description: meta description for SEO
  ```

  Use gulp if you need in  `gulpfile.js`: `All gulp tasks are this file`

  All packages are in `package.json`:

    To set up all packages just run the command in your local console: npm i

  To set up a google map you need to take a key from the Google console. Then put it in the tag <script> as it is shown below. This tag has to be located on the bottom of `_layouts/default.html` :

        <script async defer
          src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=HERE=initMap&libraries=&v=weekly">
        </script>

  To set up the coordinates of your place take them from google map and then put them in:

        assets/js/main.js -> line 15 -> const uluru = { lat: 39.7219538, lng: -91.5098444 };
